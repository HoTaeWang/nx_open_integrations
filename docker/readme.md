## Abstract ##

Starting from the build 28389 (~ 4.0 beta-2), the Nx Server allows its debian package to be 
installed directly from a Dockerfile (lower versions are incompatible). A proper systemd environment
should be started inside the Docker. There are some cases when Nx Server should restart itself 
(system updates feature does it quite often), and it relies on systemd for it. The current Docker 
image allows such a behavior.

## Restrictions ##

    Only Debian Linux container is supported.
    Linux hosts are supported.
    MacOS hosts can be used but with limitations.
    Windows hosts not tested

## Nx Server Docker container support conditions ##

*  Nx Server Docker container is an experimental feature.
*  It has not been comprehensively tested.
*  It is not recommended for critical systems.
*  Please, test carefully that all features work in your environment before using it.
*  We do not guarantee support, but we need your feedback and will try to address discovered 
issues in future releases.
*  Any support provided implies knowledge and skills of Docker when using this feature.

## Building ##

Building an image from current directory

You can use build.sh utility:

```bash
# Building from existing debian package. It will copy it to the build folder and build the image.
build.sh ~/Downloads/nxwitness-server-4.0.0.28737-linux64-beta-test.deb

# Or using url. It will download the debian package and build the image.
build.sh https://beta.networkoptix.com/beta-builds/default/28608/linux/nxwitness-server-4.0.0.28608-linux64-beta-prod.deb
```

-d|--deb <path to deb file> Uses deb file as a source
-b|--build <path to build folder    Uses build folder as a source
-u|--url <url to download>  Uses URL as a source for debian file
-n|--name <name>    Sets the name for the container.  Default is 'mediaserver'
-c|--cloud <new cloud host url> Changes the cloud host.  This is for testing purposes.
-v|--verbose    Gives verbose output when run
The script will use current directory as a docker workspace. It also copies necessary 
files (deb package) to this folder. This allows to run `build.sh` out of `nx_vms` source 
folder.

You can use docker directly:

```bash
docker build -t mediaserver --build-arg mediaserver_deb=path_to_mediaserver.deb .
```

It will fetch all necessary layers and build docker image with name `mediaserver`.

## Altering cloud_host ##

build.sh can override cloud host setting for mediaserver:

```bash
build.sh --cloud cloud-dev2.hdw.mx ~/Downloads/nxwitness-server-4.0.0.28737-linux64-beta-test.deb
```

It sets `cloud_host` build argument for docker. You can invoke it directly:

```bash
docker build -t mediaserver --build-arg cloud_host=cloud-dev2.hdw.mx --build-arg mediaserver_deb=path_to_mediaserver.deb .
```

It is possible to change cloud host for existing container instance as well: 

```bash
sudo docker exec -i -t mediaserver1 /setup/manage.sh --cloud cloud-dev2.hdw.mx
```

## Running ##

systemd needs `/run`, `/run/lock` to be present, so we need to map them.
Also container needs `/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup` to be mapped.

Running it:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name mediaserver1 --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -t mediaserver
```

OR

You can use the docker-compose file which has the run parameters set, and will provide 
volumes for persistent database and video storage.

If you are already running a Nx Server on host in the traditional way, you will either want to 
change the port setting of your server or update the port setting in the docker-compose.yaml file.
Make sure you don't have too many Docker images filing up space either. Even if the Nx Desktop 
client sees that the mounted directory has space but is filled with other things, it may claim the 
storage location is inaccessible and  Invalid storage on the Storage Management tab in Server Settings.

The docker-compose.yaml file will give you one storage location for video. If you want more storage 
locations you will need to mount additional volumes to the container.  Note that these need to be 
separate volumes on the host as well. For example:

/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro
    Mounts /sys/fs/cgroup as /sys/fs/cgroup in the Docker container in read-only mode.
./video:/recordings
    Mounts video storage on the volume ./video as /recordings in the Docker container
./data/:/opt/networkoptix/mediaserver/var
    Mounts DB storage on the volume ./data as /opt/networkoptix/mediaserver/var in the Docker container.
/media/user/f9b06bbd-8d74-4bb6-a7f3-2799223ec517/video2:/dock2 
    Mounts /media/user/f9b06bbd-8d74-4bb6-a7f3-2799223ec517/video2 as /dock2 in the Docker container
/media/user/c84fcf04-bc47-47ee-8e47-5c4f15822e8b/video3:/dock3
    Mounts /media/user/c84fcf04-bc47-47ee-8e47-5c4f15822e8b/video3 as /dock3 in Docker container.

Note that the video storage location, if modified, needs to be short. Changing the name 
is fine but changing the path may result in no valid storage location.

## Useful commands ##

Entering bash inside named container:
```bash
sudo docker exec -i -t mediaserver /bin/bash #< by name
```

Reading system logs:

```bash
sudo docker logs mediaserver
```

Reading journalctl:

```bash
sudo docker exec -i -t mediaserver journalctl -u networkoptix-mediaserver
```

Stopping the container and resetting all the data:

```
sudo docker stop mediaserver && sudo docker rm mediaserver
```

## Networking ##

The network setting of Docker container can influence Nx Server availability. Here is summary of 
the network types you can use, and the results you can expect.

Host (recommended)
Licenses in this mode will always have the MAC of the host and the MAC can't be modified 
in "host" mode.

###Pros:
*  No need to do any network configuration
*  Auto-discovery works
*  Other systems on the network can see your server
###Cons:
*  Does not work on MacOS
    
Bridge
Pros:
*  No need to do any network configuration
*  Works on MacOS
Cons:
*  The MAC address can change if you start up Servers in a different order invalidating the 
license.
*  Must connect to server manually in the desktop client
*  Auto-discovery does not work.  Cameras need to be added manually.

Macvlan
For details see: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/network/macvlan/

Pros:
*  Auto-discovery works
*  You can run multiple servers on your host
Cons:
*  Requires complicated configuration, including changes in DHCP server in your network and 
creating docker network. 
(See for details: https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-macvlan/).
*  Requires your network adapter to be in "Promiscuous" mode which can be a security risk. 
(Details here: https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/promiscuous-mode)
*  IP changes will invalidate the license unless you specify a MAC address when running the 
container.

## Licenses considerations ##

Licenses are tied to Hardware ID (HWID). Changing one identifier (including MAC) causes the HWID to 
change. That's why HWID can be accidentally invalidated by modifications to the Docker container.

For more explanations about HWID see:
https://support.networkoptix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036141153-HWID-changed-and-license-is-no-longer-recording

There are several ways that changes to the network settings can cause the HWID to change:

*  Switching container network mode from host to bridge;
*  Starting up containers in bridged mode causes them to choose sequential MAC addresses.  If 
containers are started in a different order after license keys are <code>ssigned</code>, their 
MAC address will change, also changing the HWID, and invalidating the licenses;
*  Deliberately changing the MAC address of a container;
*  Changes to internal IP of the container can cause the MAC address to change as well;
*  Moving the Docker image to another host.

This can be solved by specifying MAC address in the docker run command or in docker-compose.yaml file. For example,
```
sudo docker run -d --mac-address="8a:ca:58:b9:e9:51" --network bridge --name mediaserver1 --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -t mediaserver
```
Actions that won't invalidate a license:

*  In-client update;
*  Building a new Docker image with a new Server version but same MAC address and DB on the same host;
*  Stopping and starting the container;
*  Removing the container and starting it again from the same image and DB on the same host.

Note: If your license has been invalidated, it can be reactivated up to 3 times by contacting 
support. For more details see https://support.networkoptix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036141153-HWID-changed-and-license-is-no-longer-recording

## Software Updates ##

Both in-client and manual image updates will invalidate licenses.

In-client update:
Currently in-client update works but several limitations. 

1.  Go to "â‰¡" menu. Select System Administration... -> Updates tab.
2.  Click the Update to Specific Build button. Input build number and password and click 
"Select Build".
3.  Click the Download button.
4.  Once finished click the Install update button.
5.  The install will stay at Installing... for some time and then the Finish Update button will 
appear.
6.  Click the Finish Update button.
7.  Then click Yes button.
8.  You will now be at the Reconnecting... dialog.  This will also sit in this state.  Click 
Cancel. This will close the connection to the server.
9.  Stop your container
10. Start it again
11. Connect to the container with the Nx Desktop client.
12. Go to Updates section (see p. 1). You should see an Update successful message.
13. You may be disconnected again but connecting once more should work and the updates tab should 
show the new version.

Updating the image itself:

1.  Stop your container.
2.  Move the copy of the DB and recorded video to another folder.
3.  Remove container.
    * sudo docker container rm <container id>
4.  Remove Docker image.
    * sudo docker image rm <image id>
5.  Build new Docker image with the new Server version.
6.  Bring DB and video files back.
7.  Run the new image referencing the DB and video files.

## MacOS support ##

With this Docker container you can run a container on MacOS. It does come with some limitations.

*  "Host" networking will not work as the MacOS puts the Docker container inside a VM, not 
directly on the main OS. See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/ for details.
*  "Bridge" is probably the best option but for the reasons above requires some manual 
addition of servers and cameras


## TODO ##

1. ~~Provide a better ways to specify deb file for mediaserver.~~ Done
